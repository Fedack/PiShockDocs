**Tiny Shock:** Devices purchased prior to November 2022 require a firmware update for the Tiny Shock button to work properly. Instructions for updating your firmware can be found on our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/MrNb9CQyYA) or requested by emailing fedack@pishock.com. If you attempt to use the tiny shock button on a device that is not updated, it will send a 3 second long shock instead. As a matter of safety, this button will not work on share links if the "maximum duration" for a shock is set to less than 3 seconds.

![PiShock Shocker](https://i.imgur.com/E2mOzIo.png)
Once added, a Shocker accessed via a Share Link can be controlled like your own Shocker. If the Share link has a Timelimit, it will automatically Expire once the set time has Elapsed.


## 3. Tips
### 3.1. Portable Operation
Using the PiShock while moving around in a space such as a Convention Floor requires nothing more then a Hotspot connection as well as a External powersource. 
#### **Power** 
Powering the PiShock is as simply connecting it to a Powersouce that can supply at least `5V/2A` like a Powerbank.
<br>
It is alternatively also possible to Power the PiShock via it's GPIO Pins using a LiPo (and optionally a battery hat) for an even more portable and compact solution.

#### **Network**
To Receive Commands from the Server the PiShock requires an active internet connection.<br>
This can be achived by using a hotspot from a Mobile phone (Note: it is advised to set this up before leaving for the Event to avoid issues with the PiShock losing connection). 

### 3.2 **Pair Shocker**
Sometimes if you see that your shocker doesn't work, it can mean it is unpaired. Do the below<br>
**1:** Turn on the shocker, it will beep when you press on and the light will start flashing on the side, this means it is on.
**2:** Press and hold the button for 5 seconds, it will beep again and the light will start to flash rapidly.
**3:** Send a vibrate from the website. You have a few seconds to do that. If it vibrate, it means it is paired.

This process is the same for switching between the offline remote and the PiShock.

## 4. Firmware Update
Sometimes the software on your PiShock may need to be updated or reloaded. This may be to enable a new feature announced on our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/MrNb9CQyYA), or to troubleshoot an issue with your PiShock. To update the firmware on your device, you will need a computer running Windows 10 or Windows 11.

These instructions only apply to the current model PiShock that has been sold since November 2021. This model can be identified by a red LED on the side of the PiShock when plugged in. These instructions will not work for older models of PiShock that are based on a Raspberry Pi. Please contact our support team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/MrNb9CQyYA) if you have any questions.

1) Download and extract the [Firmware Update Tool](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DMEEUxA0sgHjLUxY-x2wLTMKEJM7iZ9O?usp=sharing).
2) Plug your PiShock into your computer using a USB cable.
3) Right click on the "PiShock Flash Tool" file and click "Run as Administrator". This is necessary to allow the software to make changes to your device.
4) You should see your PiShock listed, and it should have the word "COM" followed by a number following it's name. If not, see the steps below to troubleshoot this.
5) Select "Lite" at the bottom and then click "Flash".
6) Once the Firmware has finished loading, click on the WiFi icon next to your device, and click "Add" to configure your wireless network settings.

If the device does not show up in Step #4, or if it does not have the word "COM" following the name, try these steps:
1) Unplug the PiShock from your PC and plug it back in.
2) Try a different USB cable.
3) Download and install the CP210x Universal Driver from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DMEEUxA0sgHjLUxY-x2wLTMKEJM7iZ9O?usp=sharing).

**Note:** Normally firmware updates are not necessary. You should only follow this process if a new feature is announced that requires a firmware update, or if our support staff asks you to in order to troubleshoot an issue.
